# 99-Bottles-Of-Beer
The famous "99 Bottles Of Beer" song, programmed in Java.

.. with the added features of NOT playing the game by typing 'N' when prompted "Y/N".
.. and also, instead of being an insane alcholic, you can choose to have only 1 beer - or even 0 beers!
.. or you can have also more than 99 beers, e.g. 110, whatever floats your boat.

Features that I plan to add in future versions:
- Change "bottles of beer" to be any object as inputted by the user


What do the tests do?
-Currently, the test uses Java's JUnit API to test whether the output matches with the song lyrics.
- In the future, I can add more tests such that e.g. number of lines in output matches with number inputted by user
